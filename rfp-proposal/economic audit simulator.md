## Project Description :page_facing_up:


With the rise of DeFi applications and the growing rate of hacks that result in economic loss to users of these applications - there is an urgent need for teams to be able to test
their economic functions in a simulated substrate environment.

See gauntlet.network as an example of the services they provide on Ethereum.

I'm not proposing an actual project, this is to highlight the need for a simulation platform to test economic activity from both bad actors (hacks) and good actors (reward incentives). Hopefully this will raise awareness and promote interest from teams wishing to contribute and build a high value project in the Polkadot DeFi ecosystem.
